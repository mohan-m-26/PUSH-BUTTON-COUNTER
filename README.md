TASK DESCRIPTION – PUSH BUTTON COUNTER WITH TEMPERATURE DISPLAY

The objective of this project is to design and implement a system using an Arduino UNO, Push Buttons, LCD Display, and Temperature Sensor (LM35/TMP36/DHT11) to perform two main functions:

1. Push Button Counter
A push button is used to increment the counter value each time it is pressed.
Another button can be used to reset or decrement the counter.
The current counter value is displayed on the LCD screen in real time.

2. Temperature Measurement
The temperature sensor continuously measures the ambient temperature.
Arduino reads the analog signal, converts it to °C, and displays it alongside the counter value on the LCD.
The same data can also be monitored on the Serial Monitor for debugging.

WORKING PRINCIPLES :
The Arduino UNO acts as the control unit.
Digital input pins detect button presses and update the counter.
Analog input pin reads the voltage from the temperature sensor, which is converted to temperature.
Both Count value and Temperature value are displayed on the LCD in real-time.

FEATURES :
Dual functionality: Counting + Temperature Monitoring.
Real-time display on 16x2 LCD and Serial Monitor.
Simple and cost-effective design.
Can be expanded for smart monitoring systems.

APPLICATIONS :
Event or object counting with environment monitoring.
Classroom/student counters with temperature display.
Industrial and agricultural monitoring systems.
A base model for IoT-enabled data logging projects.
